# Sound event localization and detection (SELD) task
[Sound event localization and detection (SELD)](https://www.aane.in/research/computational-audio-scene-analysis-casa/sound-event-localization-detection-and-tracking) is the combined task of identifying the temporal onset and offset of a sound event, tracking the spatial location when active, and further associating a textual label describing the sound event.
   
## Training the network

In order to train the network follow the steps below.

* Update the dataset path in `parameter.py` script. For the above example, you will change `dataset_dir='base_folder/'`. Also provide a directory path `feat_label_dir` in the same `parameter.py` script where all the features and labels will be dumped.

* Extract features from the downloaded dataset by running the `batch_feature_extraction.py` script. First, update the parameters in the script, check the python file for more comments. You can now run the script as shown below. This will dump the normalized features and labels here. Since feature extraction is a one-time thing, this script is standalone and does not use the `parameter.py` file.

```
python batch_feature_extraction.py
```

You can now train the network using default parameters using
```
python seld.py
```

* Additionally, you can add/change parameters by using a unique identifier \<task-id\> in if-else loop as seen in the `parameter.py` script and call them as following
```
python seld.py <task-id> <job-id>
```
Where \<job-id\> is a unique identifier which is used for output filenames (models, training plots). You can use any number or string for this.
